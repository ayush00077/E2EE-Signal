# End-to-End Encryption with Signal Protocol in Flutter

## Introduction

This GitHub repository focuses on implementing end-to-end encryption using the Signal Protocol in a Flutter application. The project utilizes the `libsignal_protocol_dart` library to provide secure communication between users.

## Key Features

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: The application ensures that messages are encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted on the recipient's device, preventing any third-party access to the communication.

2. **Signal Protocol Integration**: The project integrates the Signal Protocol using the `libsignal_protocol_dart` library, which provides the necessary cryptographic primitives and protocols for secure messaging.

3. **Flutter Framework**: The application is built using the Flutter framework, allowing for cross-platform compatibility and native-like performance on both iOS and Android devices.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
